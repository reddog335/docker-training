Create a Dockerfile that will use tomcat:8.0 as the base image. 

In the Dockerfile you will have to copy the server.xml file to 
/usr/local/tomcat/conf directory with in the container.

You will also need to copy the two cert files to /usr/local/tomcat/conf 
directory to get the certs installed

last you will need to expose port 8443


Once you have the docker file created build the image and run the image.
Make sure that both 8080 and 8443 are exposed when running the image. 

list the image

To validate that tomcat is up and running correctly 
either use a browser or curl cmd.
When using ssl you will have to add an exception for the URL. 
You can use the two urls (listed below) to validate that tomcat is up and running. You
should see the tomcat page. If you use curl you will see the raw result, for the ssl URL 
you will have to use the -k option.

http://localhost:8080
https://localhost:8443
