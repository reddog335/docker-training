Lab2
Make sure to stop tomcat container from lab2.

create a swarm
validate the swarm is up and running (docker node ls)

Create a Docker stack file that will use the image from lab2

You will need to expose both ports 8080 and 8443. 

once you have the docker stack file deploy the stack as tomcatlab2


To validate that tomcat is up and running correctly 
either use a browser or curl cmd.
When using ssl you will have to add an exception for the URL. 
You can use the two urls (listed below) to validate that tomcat is up and running. You
should see the tomcat page. If you use curl you will see the raw result, for the ssl URL 
you will have to use the -k option.

http://localhost:8080
https://localhost:8443

Also so the stack and services that are running.
